# MAGIC # 2L: Introduction to Delta Lake
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this lab, you will gain hands-on experience with Delta Lake's key features:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Creating Delta tables
# MAGIC - Performing basic operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
# MAGIC - Executing MERGE operations
# MAGIC - Using time travel capabilities
# MAGIC - Optimizing performance
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We'll be using the customer data from the TPC-H dataset to work through these concepts.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## REQUIRED - SELECT CLASSIC COMPUTE
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Before executing cells in this notebook, please select your classic compute cluster in the lab. Be aware that **Serverless** is enabled by default.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Follow these steps to select the classic compute cluster:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. Navigate to the top-right of this notebook and click the drop-down menu to select your cluster. By default, the notebook will use **Serverless**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. If your cluster is available, select it and continue to the next cell. If the cluster is not shown:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC     - In the drop-down, select **More**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC     - In the **Attach to an existing compute resource** pop-up, select the first drop-down. You will see a unique cluster name in that drop-down. Please select that cluster.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **NOTE:** If your cluster has terminated, you might need to restart it in order to select it. To do this:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. Right-click on **Compute** in the left navigation pane and select *Open in new tab*.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. Find the triangle icon to the right of your compute cluster name and click it.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. Wait a few minutes for the cluster to start.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. Once the cluster is running, complete the steps above to select your cluster.

# MAGIC ## A. Classroom Setup
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Run the following cell to configure your working environment for this course. It will also set your default catalog to **dbacademy** and the schema to your specific schema name shown below using the `USE` statements.
# MAGIC <br></br>
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ```
# MAGIC USE CATALOG dbacademy;
# MAGIC USE SCHEMA dbacademy.<your unique schema name>;
# MAGIC ```
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **NOTE:** The `DA` object is only used in Databricks Academy courses and is not available outside of these courses. It will dynamically reference the information needed to run the course.

# MAGIC ## B. Creating Delta Tables
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this section, you'll create a Delta table from the TPC-H customers dataset. You'll transform the data to use more intuitive column names and filter for a specific subset of customers.

# COMMAND ----------

from pyspark.sql.functions import col

spark.sql("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS delta_customers")

## Create a Delta table named "delta_customers" from the "samples.tpch.customer" table
## Transform the data by:
## 1. Renaming columns to more intuitive names (e.g., c_custkey to customer_id)
## 2. Filtering for customers with c_mktsegment = 'BUILDING' or 'HOUSEHOLD'
## 3. Limiting to 5000 records

## HINT: Use spark.table() to access the source table and DataFrame transformations

customers_df = <FILL-IN>

# COMMAND ----------

# Inspect the data in the Delta table
display(spark.table("delta_customers"))

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## C. Exploring Table Metadata
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Let's examine the metadata of our newly created Delta table.
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC -- Inspecting the table metadata
# MAGIC DESCRIBE EXTENDED delta_customers

# COMMAND ----------

## View detailed Delta-specific metadata including statistics
<FILL-IN>

# COMMAND ----------

## Check the history of changes to the Delta table
<FILL-IN>

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## D. Basic Delta Operations
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Now you'll learn how to perform basic operations on Delta tables, including an `UPDATE` operation.
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

## Update the account_balance for customers in the BUILDING market segment
## 1. Increase their account_balance by 10%
## 2. Delete customers with a negative account balance
<FILL-IN>

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## E. Time Travel Operations
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Now let's explore Delta Lake's time travel capabilities to view and query previous versions of our data.
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

## Display a sample of records from that version, Choose a version from the history (for example, version 1)
<FILL-IN>

# COMMAND ----------

## Count the records from that version, Choose a version from the history (for example, version 1)
<FILL-IN>

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## F. Restore Operations
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Let's learn how to recover data by restoring to a previous version.
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC -- Checking the current count for the table
# MAGIC SELECT COUNT(*) as current_count FROM delta_customers;

# COMMAND ----------

## Restore the delta_customers table to a previous version (e.g. Version 1)
<FILL-IN>

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC -- Checking count again for the table
# MAGIC SELECT COUNT(*) as current_count FROM delta_customers;

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## G. Using the MERGE Function
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Now let's explore Delta Lake's powerful `MERGE` capabilities for upsert operations.
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC -- Setup a temporary view to simulated incoming updated customer data
# MAGIC CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY VIEW updated_customers AS
# MAGIC SELECT 999901 AS customer_id, 
# MAGIC        "Customer#000999901" AS name,
# MAGIC        "123 Updated Street" AS address, -- Updated address
# MAGIC        1 AS nation_id,
# MAGIC        "1-123-456-7890" AS phone,
# MAGIC        CAST(10000.00 AS DECIMAL(18,2)) AS account_balance, -- Updated balance
# MAGIC        "BUILDING" AS market_segment,
# MAGIC        "Updated customer record via MERGE" AS comment -- Updated comment
# MAGIC UNION ALL
# MAGIC -- Add a new record that doesn't exist in the table yet
# MAGIC SELECT 999999 AS customer_id,
# MAGIC        "Customer#000999999" AS name,
# MAGIC        "999 Merge Street" AS address,
# MAGIC        5 AS nation_id,
# MAGIC        "1-999-999-9999" AS phone,
# MAGIC        CAST(15000.00 AS DECIMAL(18,2)) AS account_balance,
# MAGIC        "HOUSEHOLD" AS market_segment,
# MAGIC        "New customer added via MERGE" AS comment;
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

## Perform a MERGE operation to update existing customers address, account_balance and comment fields and insert new customers
## Show the results of the two inserted or updated records 
## HINT: Use MERGE INTO with WHEN MATCHED and WHEN NOT MATCHED clauses
<FILL-IN>

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC -- Verify the results
# MAGIC SELECT * FROM delta_customers WHERE customer_id IN (999901, 999999);
